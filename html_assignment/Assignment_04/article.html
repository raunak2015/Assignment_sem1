    <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>. These early machines laid the foundation for modern computing. <em>Innovation</em> was slow but steady. <mark>Mechanical computation</mark> evolved into electronic systems. <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> became the brain of computers. The <i>difference engine</i> was a milestone. <small>Fun fact: Ada Lovelace is considered the first programmer.</small>

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors. The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, while the 2nd relied on <i>transistors</i>. The 3rd introduced <strong>integrated circuits</strong>. By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal and affordable</em>. The 5th generation focuses on <u>artificial intelligence</u>. <del>Punch cards</del> <ins>Graphical interfaces </ins> replaced old input methods <sup>Moore's Law</sup> predicted rapid growth <sub>Binary logic</sub> became essential.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
        <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. It revolutionized communication. <q>The power of the Web is in its universality.</q> <blockquote>“Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite> </blockquote> The internet connected the world <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> became universal shortcuts. <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp> <code>console.log('Hello Internet');</code> was the start of many journeys.

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber connections. Computers now fit in our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>. Cloud computing changed storage. <strong>AI and machine learning</strong> are shaping the future. <em>Cybersecurity</em> is a growing concern. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> powers the web <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> links everything. <code>lt;div&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;</code> structures pages.

      <h2>Mathematics in Computing</h2>
    <p>
        A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>. Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water. Algorithms use <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> to solve problems. <code>if (x &gt; y)</code> is a basic comparison. <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> switches windows. <samp>Program executed successfully.</samp>
